## Summer Schedule





For posterity - here's a picture of the MacCready Lab Lunch group...

For this summer, I'd like to pick up where I left off before the GRC and start looking at correlations for the trends that I'm seeing. There is a whole lot of other work to do, but I'd like to get a rought idea of other state-variables and forcing that may correlate with the trends I'm started to observe.

Some VFC To-Dos:
* Investigate differences in time-binning.
* Refine statistical understanding and presentation of errors and biases - what's the best way to do this?
* Conduct analyses of different domains, time periods, and state variables of interest.
* Continue refinenement of codebase and work towards making it more time efficient.
* Clean and incorporate more data (especially KC Whidbey Basin data).
* Synthesize trends -> paper draft toward end of 2023???
* Work with Ben/Aurora on what I can build to be helpful!

Summer Items:
* Refine and improve VFC method.
* Literature review and improvement of error estimation.
* Start synthesizing trends...
* Reach out to WWU about potential fieldwork.
