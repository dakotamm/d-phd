## Number of Casts as DOF for Confidence Intervals and Finer Depth-Binning

**I am only going to show Hood Canal plots in this blog - it would be way too long otherwise! I do have all other plots available to chat about during our meeting! Honestly there's a lot to see here; I've created a data mountain that I haven't climbed yet...**

First, I am using the number of casts as degrees-of-freedom for the confidence intervals (in lieu of using total data points previously). This will give us ***

Second, I increased the depth-resolution by creating finer bin sizes (10 total), as follows:
* <5m
* 5-10m
* 10-15m
* 15-30m
* 30-50m
* 50-75m
* 75-100m
* 100-150m
* 150-200m
* >200m

I've selected a few bins to show. We can see that for Hood Canal, we observed ****

## Seasonal Averaging!

Previously, I've focused heavily on monthly averages. Now, I'm recreating the same plots as above with seasonal averages.

## Exploring Sampling Depth Variation

***these three look pretty similar! sampling depth consistency even with different temporal resolution!

## Average Casts During Time Periods/Seasons

Another ask from last week was to create DO vs. Z profiles from data and create binned averages PER season and time period. I've defined some time periods as follows:
* Pre-1945
* 1945-1980
* 1980-1995
* 1995-On

Creating these profiles will allow us to see where sampling depth and DO variation occurs between samples and if adjustments for sampling depth are necessary*** 

Note there is no data in Hood Canal between 1980 and 1995.***

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/dakotamm/dakotamm.github.io/assets/55995675/09d8ef6d-df78-495a-9513-f4c76994da41" width="800"/><br>Fig 12. Hood Canal DO vs. depth for all seasons pre-1945; all data is plotted and average in 1-m bins.</p><br>

## Miscellaneous

Thoughts for posterity:
* Review Collias publications for early data context.
* Zooming in on Hood Canal trends (most apparent change in CT/SA/DO over time) - focus on hypotheses for trends here, build tools for whole system analysis.
* Gappy temperature data in SOG - investigate this.
* 1970-2000 data - does it exist? Ask around...(DOE, Mesa Program)
* Skagit data

## Planning

Last week, we chatted about Ocean Sciences and the direction for Paper 1. Here's some summary:

* 2/22: Ocean Sciences Poster
  * Focus on Puget Sound observed DO/CT/SA trends and uncertainty
    * Exclude King County data, ORCA buoys, Whidbey mooring data for now (mooring data could provide short-time scale analysis/later hypothesis testing)
    * Analysis of correlation with physical environmental data (like river flow)
    * Potentially use volume-weighted averages?
  * **Main focus through February**

* Spring/Summer 2023: Paper 1
  * Continuation of Ocean Sciences poster...
    * Long term trends in Puget Sound DO (similar to Riche et al. 2014, Moore et al. 2008)
    * Emerging story of changing atmospheric and environmental conditions
      * Low river flow leads to less efficient exchange flow and longer residence times may be associated with lower DO
        * Less stratified, saltier over time, warmer over time?
  * Some collaboration with Stefano and PSI - but largely take the lead and time I need to write this paper. Yay!
  * Presentations at the end of summer to/with PSI?

* Spring 2023: General Exam (Thesis Proposal)
  * Part 1: Paper 1 content!
  * Part 2: ??? specific regional analyses
  * Since I already have a Masters (albeit in a different group), how many "chapters" are warranted? I've heard two for pre-existing MSCEs...
  * Where does Penn Cove stuff fit? Learning how to run LO?
  * Incorporating reading...especially Riche et al. 2014 and Moore and Mantua 2008 (likely reading bulk **after** Ocean Sciences).
  * **Need to assemble committee! Evidently Michelle can GSR**
  * **Firmer grasp of timeline after Ocean Sciences**

---

## Bookkeeping 
* Ocean Sciences: 2/18/-2/23
  * Need to register! **Should I sign up for the Student Presentation Evaluation Program (SPEP)? Feedback, but can't see other posters during session...**
  * Booked: flights, accommodations - **need to reimburse**
* New computer! :)
* PECS - on the radar

---

### Looking Ahead:
1. ORCA buoys - incorporate this into trend analysis ASAP.
2. KC data cleaning - ascertain the relative impact to the trends found; complete data incorporation into LO ecosystem.
3. Upwelling data - look into NANOOS NVS (NDBC or the NSF OOI Endurance Array).
4. Are warming events more common in NE Pacific? Paper??? (Ref. [this](https://www.pugetsoundinstitute.org/2023/09/warm-ocean-waters-work-their-way-into-puget-sound/))
5. Penn Cove nitrogen budget with WWU + Penn Cove nested model...
6. Keep on Taylor for me to be involved in KC Whidbey sampling...

### Goals For This Week:
1. See next data analysis steps above.
