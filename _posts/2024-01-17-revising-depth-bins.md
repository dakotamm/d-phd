# Revising Sampling Depth Bins Toward Change in Average Profiles Over Time

### Goals From Last Meeting:
1. Set up my new computer!
2. Work on presentation for class.
3. Break out Lynch Cove from Hood Canal.
4. Rebin based on bottle data sampling depths.
5. Create average seasonal casts for each of SA/CT/DO and each time period + assess confidence intervals...(eliminate depth bin if too large)?
6. Submit Ocean Sciences + computer reimburesements.

## Rebinning + Assessing Evolution of Average Seasonal Casts Over Time

**Again, I am only going to show Hood Canal due to sheer volume of info!**

First, I updated by regions such that Hood Canal and Lynch Cove are processed separately. There is one cast with deep DO in Lynch Cove (~200m) but I believe that's erroneous and/or improperly located.

Second, I create depth bins by looking at bottle samples (very manually). Here's some plots of DO bottle samples in Hood Canal.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/dakotamm/dakotamm.github.io/assets/55995675/4251b959-6cee-4c14-9d92-b15225422f87" width="800"/><br>Fig 1. Hood Canal SA/CT/DO monthly average time series <5m depth.</p><br>

Roughly, I created bins with edges at half meters through the first 10m, then incremented to 5m-intervals centered around even 5m depths. At around 50m, the resolution increases to 10m-intervals and then up to 30m-intervals at depth. This made the most sense to me but I'm open to revisions and also ways to make this less manual.

Now, I created averages within each depth bin using bottle data only and then calculated each bins confidence interval for each time period (see plots), variable (SA/CT/DO), and season. That yielded the following plots for Hood Canal! Individual colored points are individual bottle samples. (Note these plots took stubbornly long to make and it's the extent of the plotting for this week.)

The intent of creating these plots is a) to see if the average profiles have changed over time and b) to be able to use these to compare across time periods when discussing trends at depth. I think there is not a clear change in these profiles over time that isn't within 95% confidence intervals, but perhaps further refining is important. Importantly, the confidence intervals (in Hood Canal) are fairly significant, which brings some difficulty to "weighting" based on these average casts when comparing across depths. However it's a good start!

## Miscellaneous

Next steps:
* Different time periods for above analysis?
* Regional analyses like above for Hood Canal
* Interregional comparison of sampling depths!!!
* Explore large CI data points
* Clean up plotting - how to show this succinctly?

Thoughts for posterity:
* Review Collias publications for early data context.
* Zooming in on Hood Canal trends (most apparent change in CT/SA/DO over time) - focus on hypotheses for trends here, build tools for whole system analysis.
* Gappy temperature data in SOG - investigate this.
* 1970-2000 data - does it exist? Ask around...(DOE, Mesa Program)
* Skagit data + trends

## Planning

* 2/22: Ocean Sciences Poster
  * Focus on Puget Sound observed DO/CT/SA trends and uncertainty
    * Exclude King County data, ORCA buoys, Whidbey mooring data for now (mooring data could provide short-time scale analysis/later hypothesis testing)
    * Analysis of correlation with physical environmental data (like river flow)
    * Potentially use volume-weighted averages?
  * **Main focus through February**

* Spring/Summer 2023: Paper 1
  * Continuation of Ocean Sciences poster...
    * Long term trends in Puget Sound DO (similar to Riche et al. 2014, Moore et al. 2008)
    * Emerging story of changing atmospheric and environmental conditions
      * Low river flow leads to less efficient exchange flow and longer residence times may be associated with lower DO
        * Less stratified, saltier over time, warmer over time?
  * Some collaboration with Stefano and PSI - but largely take the lead and time I need to write this paper. Yay!
  * Presentations at the end of summer to/with PSI?

* Spring 2023: General Exam (Thesis Proposal)
  * Part 1: Paper 1 content!
  * Part 2: ??? specific regional analyses
  * Since I already have a Masters (albeit in a different group), how many "chapters" are warranted? I've heard two for pre-existing MSCEs...
  * Where does Penn Cove stuff fit? Learning how to run LO?
  * Incorporating reading...especially Riche et al. 2014 and Moore and Mantua 2008 (likely reading bulk **after** Ocean Sciences).
  * **Need to assemble committee! Evidently Michelle can GSR**
  * **Firmer grasp of timeline after Ocean Sciences**

## Bookkeeping 
* Ocean Sciences: 2/18/-2/23
  * Booked: flights, accommodations - **need to reimburse**
* New computer! :) - **need to reimburse**
* PECS - on the radar

### Looking Ahead:
1. KC data cleaning - ascertain the relative impact to the trends found; complete data incorporation into LO ecosystem.
2. Upwelling data - look into NANOOS NVS (NDBC or the NSF OOI Endurance Array).
3. Are warming events more common in NE Pacific? Paper??? (Ref. [this](https://www.pugetsoundinstitute.org/2023/09/warm-ocean-waters-work-their-way-into-puget-sound/))
4. Penn Cove nitrogen budget with WWU + Penn Cove nested model...
5. Keep on Taylor for me to be involved in KC Whidbey sampling...

### Goals For This Week:
1. See next data analysis steps above.
