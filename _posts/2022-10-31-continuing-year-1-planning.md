# Continuing Year 1 Planning

### Goals for Last Week:
1. YCSECA - poster preparation.
2. Finalize Year 1 schedule + 1-pager for KC (i.e., hypoxic volume estimation using DFO data set through fall quarter and more per 10/24 discussion).
3. Continue work on coming up to Python/LO speed.

### Completed Goals:
1. YCSECA - poster preparation.
2. Continued progress on Year 1 schedule + 1-pager for KC - Year 1 plan below, 1-pager draft separately.
3. Continue work on coming up to Python/LO speed.

### Year 1 Plan DRAFT

Guiding Science Question: What are the long- (several decade) and short-term (within the last decade) trends in dissolved oxygen and affecting factors in Puget Sound and the Salish Sea?

#### Autumn 2022
Quarter Science Question: Using data from a single source, how has hypoxic volume changed over time in the Salish Sea?
  - Selected data source: Canadian Department of Fisheries & Oceans (DFO) CTD & bottle casts due to temporal range (since 1930s), spatial coverage of the Strait of Georgia, relative completeness within these ranges, and existing data framework.

1. Within existing framework, create method to understand volume-based (hypsographic) estimates for state variables (e.g., temperature, dissolved oxygen).
2. Understand long term trends in hypoxic volume within DFO data set.

#### Winter 2023
Quarter Science Question: How do trends in hypoxic volume vary between data sets?
  - Data Sources:
    - King County
    - WA Dept. of Ecology
    - Collias
    - USGS (rivers)
    - NCDC (climatology)
    - WOAC cruises
    - NANOOS (ORCA buoys)
    - Port Susan Stillaguamish mooring
    - more...?

1. Pull existing data sets into framework.
2. Apply method derived during Autumn quarter for volume-based estimates of state variables to additional data sets.
3. As part of this process, begin to build validation routines for LO.
4. Take qualifying exams.

#### Spring 2023
Quarter Science Question: Synthesize and analyze long-term trends in hypoxic volume and related metrcs for the Salish Sea and Puget Sound.
1. Compare findings in data sets for region-specific information and cross-validation between sources.
2. Begin draft of journal paper: methods, literature review (ongoing).
3. Continue work on LO validation.
4. Potential WOAC cruise (April).

#### Summer 2023
Quarter Science Question: Continue to synthesize and analyze long-term trends in hypoxic volume and related metrcs for the Salish Sea and Puget Sound.
1. Target journal paper draft completion by end of summer.

#### Ahead
1. Given higher resolution data within most recent decade, what shorter-term trends in water quality in Salish Sea? What mechanisms might contribute to observed trends?
2. Identify data gaps - how might this inform future field work?
3. Conference preparation.

### Issues/Questions:
1. Where does WWTP effluent data come from? WWTP plants themselves? KC?
2. Is my data source list complete?

### Looking Ahead:
1. YCSECA - OOO Thursday, 11/3 through Sunday, 11/6.
2. Finalize Year 1 schedule + 1-pager for KC by Friday, 11/4 (meeting with KC that I won't be able to attend, but will still provide deliverables).
3. Meeting regarding Port Susan Stillaguamish mooring on Wednesday, 11/2.
4. Start building strategy for volume-based state variable estimates (talk to Kate Hewitt and Sam Fung, dig into Carstensen (Baltic) analyses).

### Goals For Next Week:
1. Finalize Year 1 schedule + 1-pager for KC by Friday, 11/4.
2. Meeting regarding Port Susan Stillaguamish mooring on Wednesday, 11/2.
3. Start building strategy for volume-based state variable estimates.
