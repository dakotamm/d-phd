# Resetting After Holidays and Sampling Depth Over Time Update

### Goals From Last Meeting:
1. Continue to scope future work (ongoing).
2. Update confidence intervals to use degrees-of-freedom in lieu of number of data points.
3. Investigate Saanich Inlet breakout.
4. Investigate sampling depth change over time for DO.
   
### Completed Goals:
1. Investigated sampling depth change over time for DO.
2. Holidays!!!

## Sampling Depth Over Time Updates

During break, I sent an update which considered the average sampling depth over time for DO throughout the water column to understand if changes in sampling technique has influenced data over the years. I sent plots which considered the entire depth of the cast, and got comments to consider bucketing by depth. I've done that as follows.

With all of these plots, it's hard to see a trend at first glance. It's also really challenging to infer anything given years missing data (**does anyone have this?!**) and the large confidence intervals in earlier data. I also want to note that Figure 8 shows that Southern Strait of Georgia has really low DO in recent years. I believe this is due to oversampling at Saanich Inlet (as usual). If I have time before the meeting, I'll break out Saanich Inlet versus the rest of the Southern Strait of Georgia.

I already have put so many plots here, but I do have seasonal time series, time series for a mid-depth bin (15-35m) and shallow bin (<15m), and time series for all measuresed variables (spoiler alert: it's pretty sparse with most of the other ones in earlier years). I can share these outside of the blogpost.

Next steps here:
* I have Skagit discharge data since 1940...explore the correlation between monthly discharge and CT/SA/DO?
* Volume-weighted averages?
* Saanich Inlet breakout (if I can't get to it today)

## Planning

Last week, we chatted about Ocean Sciences and the direction for Paper 1. Here's some summary:

* 2/22: Ocean Sciences Poster
  * Focus on Puget Sound observed DO/CT/SA trends and uncertainty
    * Exclude King County data, ORCA buoys, Whidbey mooring data for now (mooring data could provide short-time scale analysis/later hypothesis testing)
    * Analysis of correlation with physical environmental data (like river flow)
    * Potentially use volume-weighted averages?

* Spring/Summer 2023: Paper 1
  * Continuation of Ocean Sciences poster...
    * long term trends in Puget Sound DO (similar to Riche et al. 2014, Moore et al. 2008)
    * Emerging story of changing atmospheric and environmental conditions
      * low river flow leads to less efficient exchange flow and longer residence times may be associated with lower DO
        * less stratified, saltier over time, warmer over time?

* Spring 2023: General Exam (Thesis Proposal)
  * Part 1: Paper 1 content!
  * Part 2: ??? specific regional analyses
  * Since I already have a Masters (albeit in a different group), how many "chapters" are warranted? I've heard two for pre-existing MSCEs...
  * Where does Penn Cove stuff fit? Learning how to run LO?
  * Incorporating reading...
  * **NOTE:** Stefano (PSI) reached out regarding my thesis proposal and potential collaboration... Thoughts?

## Bookkeeping 
* Vacation: 12/18-12/22
* Ocean Sciences: 2/18/-2/23 - Airbnb booked!
* General Exam Timeline?

### Looking Ahead:
1. ORCA buoys - incorporate this into trend analysis ASAP.
2. KC data cleaning - ascertain the relative impact to the trends found; complete data incorporation into LO ecosystem.
3. Upwelling data - look into NANOOS NVS (NDBC or the NSF OOI Endurance Array).
4. Are warming events more common in NE Pacific? Paper??? (Ref. [this](https://www.pugetsoundinstitute.org/2023/09/warm-ocean-waters-work-their-way-into-puget-sound/) Puget Sound Institute article Parker pointed toward me...)
5. Penn Cove nitrogen budget with WWU + Penn Cove nested model...
6. Keep on Taylor for me to be involved in KC Whidbey sampling...

### Goals For This Week:
1.
