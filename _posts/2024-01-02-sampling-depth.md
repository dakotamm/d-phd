1. Continue to scope future work (ongoing).
2. Update confidence intervals to use degrees-of-freedom in lieu of number of data points.
3. Investigate Saanich Inlet breakout.
4. Investigate sampling depth change over time for DO.
   
### Completed Goals:

## Sampling Depth Over Time Updates

During break, I sent an update which considered the average sampling depth over time for DO throughout the water column to understand if changes in sampling technique has influenced data over the years. I sent plots which considered the entire depth of the cast, and got comments to consider binning by depth. I've done that as follows.

I can do any breakout of depths, but I've kept it consistent with other variables I've reported so far. I'm happy to create more plots to further investigate this question.

Alex also brought up a good point that the sampling depth increase from 2010 to 2020 may correlate to the decrease in observed average dissolved oxygen on average...more investigation to follow!

Next steps here:
* Confidence intervals based on cast number, in lieu of data points (degrees-of-freedom).
* Seasonal averages (with nice contrasting colors!) + annual averages for CT/SA/DO.
* I have Skagit discharge data since 1940...explore the correlation between monthly discharge and CT/SA/DO?
* Consider control for sampling depth and correlation to observed trends.

Other thoughts from before break:
* Review Collias publications for early data context.
* Zooming in on Hood Canal trends (most apparent change in CT/SA/DO over time) - focus on hypotheses for trends here, build tools for whole system analysis.
* Gappy temperature data in SOG - investigate this.
* 1970-2000 data - does it exist? Ask around...(DOE, Mesa Program)

## Planning

Last week, we chatted about Ocean Sciences and the direction for Paper 1. Here's some summary:

* 2/22: Ocean Sciences Poster
  * Focus on Puget Sound observed DO/CT/SA trends and uncertainty
    * Exclude King County data, ORCA buoys, Whidbey mooring data for now (mooring data could provide short-time scale analysis/later hypothesis testing)
    * Analysis of correlation with physical environmental data (like river flow)
    * Potentially use volume-weighted averages?
  * **Main focus through February**

* Spring/Summer 2023: Paper 1
  * Continuation of Ocean Sciences poster...
    * Long term trends in Puget Sound DO (similar to Riche et al. 2014, Moore et al. 2008)
    * Emerging story of changing atmospheric and environmental conditions
      * Low river flow leads to less efficient exchange flow and longer residence times may be associated with lower DO
        * Less stratified, saltier over time, warmer over time?
  * Some collaboration with Stefano and PSI - but largely take the lead and time I need to write this paper. Yay!
  * Presentations at the end of summer to/with PSI?

* Spring 2023: General Exam (Thesis Proposal)
  * Part 1: Paper 1 content!
  * Part 2: ??? specific regional analyses
  * Since I already have a Masters (albeit in a different group), how many "chapters" are warranted? I've heard two for pre-existing MSCEs...
  * Where does Penn Cove stuff fit? Learning how to run LO?
  * Incorporating reading...especially Riche et al. 2014 and Moore and Mantua 2008 (likely reading bulk **after** Ocean Sciences).
  * **Need to assemble committee! Evidently Michelle can GSR**
  * **Firmer grasp of timeline after Ocean Sciences**

## Bookkeeping 
* Ocean Sciences: 2/18/-2/23
  * Need to register! **Should I sign up for the Student Presentation Evaluation Program (SPEP)? Feedback, but can't see other posters during session...**
  * Booked: flights, accommodations - **need to reimburse**
* New computer! :)
* PECS - on the radar

### Looking Ahead:
1. ORCA buoys - incorporate this into trend analysis ASAP.
2. KC data cleaning - ascertain the relative impact to the trends found; complete data incorporation into LO ecosystem.
3. Upwelling data - look into NANOOS NVS (NDBC or the NSF OOI Endurance Array).
4. Are warming events more common in NE Pacific? Paper??? (Ref. [this](https://www.pugetsoundinstitute.org/2023/09/warm-ocean-waters-work-their-way-into-puget-sound/))
5. Penn Cove nitrogen budget with WWU + Penn Cove nested model...
6. Keep on Taylor for me to be involved in KC Whidbey sampling...

### Goals For This Week:
1. See next data analysis steps above.
