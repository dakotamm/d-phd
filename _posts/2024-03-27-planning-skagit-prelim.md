## Planning and Logistics

In the wake of a very busy end-of-quarter and a week off last week, I am putting my thoughts back together! A few things are top of mind:

### Meeting with Taylor

Taylor set a meeting with me to chat about some "spiffy extra DO data" she has this Wednesday 3/28. Happy to report back when I learn more.

### General Exam

Time to go pedal to the metal! I've assembled my committee, as follows:
* Alex (co-chair, advisor)
* Parker (co-chair, advisor)
* Mike (member)
* Taylor (member)
* Michelle (GSR)

Confirming that this is sufficient and these roles are correct? If so, I will **send this committee info to CEE**, as required.

I will also send an email with this information and to set a date. Regarding scheduling, my understanding is that usually the document is submitted two weeks before the exam - **Alex, can you confirm this?**

If so, here are some dates that I've pencilled out so I can start working backward:
* 5/31-ish: provide document for review
* 6/14-ish: general exam defense

OR

* 6/14-ish: provide document for review
* 6/28-ish: general exam defense

A few questions to follow this:
* When is a final document intended to be submitted?
* Do you think this is enough time???

Once I get our take on the dates in this meeting, I'll send out an email to committee members to try and finalize a date and time. I'd like to book **OSB 310** if possible (given it will be June and CEE buildings don't jive with AC)! I'll **submit the CEE General Exam request form 3 weeks prior to the date** and then **send details for the exam to CEE so they can send out an announcement at least one week before**.

For the next week, I'd like to:
* Nail down dates with committee.
* Put together a schedule of milestones given the dates we decide.
* Start constructing literature review.
* Compile scope ideas for review (e.g., what are my chapters 2 and 3 going to look like?) - I'd like to discuss feasibility of these options next week.

### Writing Paper 1

Alongside the General Exam, it seems like my "first chapter" will become a paper. I think I'm inherently intimidated by first authoring a paper, and I think understanding this scope as I start to outline my general would be great. Perhaps we plan to discuss this also more concretely next week and incorporate this into my General Exam schedule and plan.

### Class This Quarter

Along with the General Exam, I really would like to squeeze in CSE 512 - Data Visualization. I tried last year, and I know you have cautioned against it... :) ...

As I get to this General Exam phase, I'm starting to consider future options. I want to really build out my data science skills and I am worried that there will "never be a good time" to take this class. I can, however, take it next year or take another class to satisfy by Data Science certificate requirements, but I think Data Visualization is the most important one for me so far.

There is also a "final project" and I would absolutely want to use our data and continue our work.

I will drop it if it feels like it will be too much, and/or if you really feel strongly that I shouldn't.

### Teaching Opportunities

I recently have pursued an opportunity for teaching undergrad fluid mechanics for July/August at a Northeastern campus in Seattle. Again, I am keeping in mind building my experience for next steps! I am early in this process, but it could be a cool opportunity.

There is also a May/June course (but that timing doesn't work with the current layout of for my General Exam). Evidently, the materials are prepared and they just need a lecturer. I've never lead a class but need to at some point if I want to pursue teaching! I'm curious your thoughts.

Keeping in mind also potentially teaching undergrad "Waves and Tides" (Sam Kastner's current class) at Western...

### Speaking Opportunities

Here's some speaking opportunities that could be cool and/or may be important:

* PCC climate change-related talk (Schooner Series by Cascadia Climate Action group) at Bickerson Brewhouse - 10-15 minute public talk about local climate change impacts!
  * 1-2 sentences about proposed topic...could be really cool!!!
* eScience Institute Data Science Seminars - every quarter, 35-40 minutes, usually very AI/ML-heavy, but they do have quite a range of work.
* Puget Sound Institute workshops/presentations - plug in with Marielle as results develop?

### Puget Sound Institute Meeting Follow-Ups

Some quick thoughts:
* Connecting with Johannessen et al. for sediment cores?
* Connecting with Chris Krembs
* What's next for us?

### PECS Objectives

Keeping this here (for General, Paper, etc. too):
1. Quantify changes/trends on all timescales, considering spatial variation.
2. Identify drivers of changes.

## Skagit River Decadal Correlations

For the PECS abstract and after follow-up conversations after Ocean Sciences, I have started to look at Skagit River correlation with decadal trends in our big 3: DO, salinity, and temperature. Here's a MONSTER PLOT!!!

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/dakotamm/dakotamm.github.io/assets/55995675/17247b7f-0278-49ff-9bfa-b65fa164a1f7" width="800"/><br>Fig 1. Selected decadal average DO profiles with Skagit yearly and decadal mean discharge.</p><br>

This is a first pass at correlative analysis. More discussion to follow!

## Miscellaneous

Thoughts for posterity:
* Review Collias publications for early data context.
* Zooming in on Hood Canal trends (most apparent change in CT/SA/DO over time) - focus on hypotheses for trends here, build tools for whole system analysis.
* Gappy temperature data in SOG - investigate this.
* 1970-2000 data - does it exist? Ask around...(DOE, Mesa Program)


---

## Bookkeeping
* Ocean Sciences - need to reimburse flight-related transportation, per diems, and poster printing. **Should I use the same CEE budget?**
* PECS - abstract submitted
* PCC Schooner Series - want to submit 3/27
* General Exam - tracking mid-late June
* ...

---

### Looking Ahead:
1. KC data cleaning - ascertain the relative impact to the trends found; complete data incorporation into LO ecosystem.
2. Upwelling data - look into NANOOS NVS (NDBC or the NSF OOI Endurance Array).
3. Are warming events more common in NE Pacific? Paper??? (Ref. [this](https://www.pugetsoundinstitute.org/2023/09/warm-ocean-waters-work-their-way-into-puget-sound/))
4. Penn Cove nitrogen budget with WWU + Penn Cove nested model...
5. Keep on Taylor for me to be involved in KC Whidbey sampling...

### Goals For This Week:
1. ...
