# KC Meeting/EFM Presentation Debrief and Volume-From-Casts Method

### Goals From Last Week:
1. Revise LO output vs. cast area plots - plot "subthershold thickness."
2. Gordon Conference abstract
3. KC deliverables
4. EFM presentation
5. Continue on volume-from-casts method.

### Completed Goals:
1. Created "subthreshold thickness" plots.
2. Gordon Conference abstract - submitted 2/21/2022.
3. KC deliverables - presented 2/24/2023.
4. EFM presentation - presented 2/23/2023.
5. Continue on volume-from-casts method.

## KC and EFM Presentations Debrief

Last week, I presented at the EFM meeting on Thursday, 2/23/2023 and for King County at our quarterly meeting on Friday, 2/24/2023. Both presentations went well. On Thursday, I presented plots which had a bug; this was corrected for Friday. A few comments from the meetings:

*EFM Meeting:*
1. Suggestion to look at the number of casts in an area required to converge on model solution.
2. Technical questions about underestimation (largely due to the bug in the plotting that was resolved after the meeting).

*KC Meeting:*
1. Suggestion to look at density versus depth bins for hypsometry (from Susan).
2. Mike emailed me regarding whether or not "fjordal" is a word - I showed him some literature using the term but I'm happy to omit this in the future. Thoughts?
3. I felt like my presentation was too brief?
4. KC fieldwork - punted, but want to keep this on the backburner.

**Any other comments?**

## Volume-From-Casts Method

Given the push at the end of last week, I have not progressed too much further in the volume-from-casts method and/or error quantification. However, to follow up last week: I am able to create sections through land with Parker's revised code, which may help to evaluate sources of error in the volume-from-casts method. Figure 5 shows an updated transect using LO model output through East Sound taken July 1, 2022.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55995675/221960901-d2cab33b-7acb-4e8b-844c-a7cfe2a04c05.png" width="600"/><br>Fig 5. DO transect from LO output data taken September 1, 2022.</p><br>

East Sound in the transect has bottom hypoxia, as seems to be the trend in shallow embayments; this would not be captured in the current estimation schemes. The intent of working in section space is to replicate this with the volume from casts method, understanding what is missing throughout the water column.

In general, however, there is not evidence of "DO inversions" within these transects which was hyppthesized to account for some error (Figure 2). More transects and three-dimensional studies are needed.

Rough next steps for volume-from-casts method:
1. Understand the "constant offset" seen in preliminary study (Figure 2).
2. Try throughout the domain.
3. Realistic time domains.
4. Quantify errors - *what does this entail? Bias/RMSE?*
6. Figure out how many transects in time/space required to converge on solution, compare to actual.

### Issues/Questions:
1. How to do transect from casts...things to noodle on.
2. Common error estimation methods - need lit. review.
3. Figure out comments section on blog!!!

### Looking Ahead:
1. Start error-estimations for volume-from-casts method.
2. Expand volume-from-casts method domains.
3. Gordon Conference registratation.
4. Book AGU Ocean Visions.
