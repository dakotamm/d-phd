## KC and EFM Presentations Debrief

Last week, I presented at the EFM meeting on Thursday, 2/23/2023 and for King County at our quarterly meeting on Friday, 2/24/2023. Both presentations went well. On Thursday, I presented plots which had a bug; this was corrected for Friday. A few comments from the meetings:

*EFM Meeting:*
1. Suggestion to look at the number of casts in an area required to converge on model solution.
2. Technical questions about underestimation (largely due to the bug in the plotting that was resolved after the meeting).

*KC Meeting:*
1. Suggestion to look at density versus depth bins for hypsometry (from Susan).
2. Mike emailed me regarding whether or not "fjordal" is a word - I showed him some literature using the term but I'm happy to omit this in the future. Thoughts?
3. I felt like my presentation was too brief?
4. KC fieldwork - punted, but want to keep this on the backburner.

**Any other comments?**

## Volume-From-Casts Method

With Parker's revised code, I am able to create transects through land, which may help to evaluate sources of error in the volume-from-casts method. Figure 1 shows an updated transect using LO model output through East Sound taken July 1, 2022.



<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55995675/220457281-181ae871-e379-4892-8022-e382f4d4943c.png" width="600"/><br>Fig 1. DO transect from LO output data taken July 1, 2022.</p><br>

(Noting that what appears to be East Sound in the transect has bottom hypoxia, as seems to be the trend in shallow embayments.)

Perhaps my transect isn't where it thinks it is? Is something wonky with the land mask and/or wet and dry gridcells? Is this "extra volume" causing errors in my LO output data measurements? Likely my own user error somewhere...
