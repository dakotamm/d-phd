## GRC Reflection

Last week was a super exciting and valuable experience and I was glad to participate! After awesome and totally novel talks about hurricane resilience, internal waves caused by glacial calving, and subterranean estuaries suffice to say my mind is sufficiently blown and I'm really excited to be a part of this awesome community. I really appreaicated the speakers' ability to engage the audience and certainly hope to use that as inpiration for future work. In particular, I found Susan Allen's teaching style to be super effective!



data from 2008-2017 (mainly obs, with some LO history and LO casts). More on this in the poster review.

*Given the huge coding effort this week, I have not yet had time to fully vet all of these results.*

I'll leave my updated to-do list here.

This is the first step among many steps, but at least is a fun and exciting first look at some observational data. Here are some next steps (some from the KC meeting, but generally):
* ~~Get set up to run on perigee - in lieu of using just one history file to represent a month for personal computer space efficiency, start working with the full suite of model data and perform analyses more quickly.~~
* ~~Incorporate variable inversions + cast depth checking.~~
* ~~Start looking at interannual variability.~~
* Investigate differences in time-binning.
* Investigate Whidbey Basin vs. Strait of Geogia (e.g.) differences in error (Whidbey Basin tends to have less throughout the year).
* Apply uncertainties to measurements of subthreshold volumes estimated with VFC.
* Refine statistical understanding and presentation of errors and biases - what's the best way to do this?
* ~~Conduct analysis of hypoxic volume (<2.0 mg/L).~~
* Conduct analyses of different domains, time periods, and state variables of interest.
* Continue refinenement of codebase and work towards making it more time efficient.
* Clean and incorporate more data (especially KC Whidbey Basin data).
* ~~Define GRC poster scope.~~
* Synthesize trends -> paper draft toward end of 2023???
* Work with Ben/Aurora on what I can build to be helpful!
