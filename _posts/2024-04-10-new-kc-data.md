# Catching Up, Planning, and Some Skagit Correlations

### Goals From Last Meeting:
1. Bring in new KC data (from Taylor, Whidbey CTDs, KC bottle).
2. Review Whidbey Basin scope feasibility.
3. Review decadal resolution from KC historic sampling stations.
5. Planning/writing general exam.
6. Schedule General Exam.
   
### Completed Goals:
1. Brought in new KC data (from Taylor, Whidbey CTDs, KC bottle) - working on more QCed CTD data from Greg Ikeda.
2. Reviewed Whidbey Basin scope feasibility.
3. Reviewed decadal resolution from KC historic sampling stations.
4. Planning/writing/scheduling ongoing - need Mike confirmation.

## New KC Data

This week, I've finished some long-standing data cleaning and brought in some new data. These sources are as follows:

1. Taylor's "old KC site" bottle data (1965-2000)
2. KC's non-QCed bottle data (1965-present)
3. KC's non-QCed Whidbey Basin CTD data (2022-present)

I also have just seen Greg Ikeda's upload of QCed CTD data for all of KC's Puget Sound monitoring, so I'll bring that in too. I've used Parker's standad LO data processing so it's easy to incorporate my analysis. In this process I've made a collection of every decade's and year's sampling locations, which has provided a really good reference of a ton of information. I've made separate plots for every time window, season, and available variable (***double check NH4). Here's an example of what a plot looks like, colored by source for summer 1969 DO.

Part of this exercise was to understand if Taylor's historic KC data provided any additional decadal resolution at any of my sites with multi-decadal time histories. Naturally, King County's sampling occurs around King County. The only station with additional decadal information is in the 1990s at Alki during summer and fall. This is helpful but doesn't fill the entire gap of missing data at our referenced sites around Puget Sound. However, it does provide a cool "Main Basin near Seatte" multi-decadal analysis opportunity. I'll explore this further.

I also investigated the feasability of a deep dive into Whidbey Basin for a portion of my thesis. As we discussed last week, the big thing to understand is whether or not there is any observable variability on annual timescales. Most sampling seems has taken place during my defined sumemr months, so I show five different summer time periods with consistent sampling locations.

*Dakota to add more words about this here. Some notes:*
* I still need to set a meeting with Taylor on her thoughts on feasibility here...
* Inconsistent sampling depths?
* Yearly gappiness.
* Change seasonal distinct

## Miscellaneous

Thoughts for posterity:
* Any SOG focus for thesis?!
* Review Collias publications for early data context.
* Gappy temperature data in SOG - investigate this.
* 1970-2000 data - does it exist? Ask around...(DOE, Mesa Program) - Taylor provided more KC monitoring data in this time.


---

## Bookkeeping
* Ocean Sciences - reimbursements submitted
* Schooner Series...
* General Exam - tracking mid-late June

### Looking Ahead:
1. Upwelling data - look into NANOOS NVS (NDBC or the NSF OOI Endurance Array).
2. Are warming events more common in NE Pacific? Paper??? (Ref. [this](https://www.pugetsoundinstitute.org/2023/09/warm-ocean-waters-work-their-way-into-puget-sound/))
3. Penn Cove nitrogen budget with WWU + Penn Cove nested model...
4. Keep on Taylor for me to be involved in KC Whidbey sampling...

### Goals For This Week:
1. Schedule General officially.
2. Schedule meeting with Taylor about Whidbey scope feasability if necessary after this meeting.
3. READ AND WRITE!
