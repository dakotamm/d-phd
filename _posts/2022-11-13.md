### Issues/Questions:
1. I missed the KC meeting on Friday, 11/4/2022 due to the YCSECA. Can we debrief?
2. Takeaways from Stillaguamish/KC meeting.

### Looking Ahead:
1. Reach out to Susan Allen regarding access to DFO data and use requirements.
2. Dig deep into building volume-based state variable estimates (noting Kate Hewitt & Sam Fung as potential resources + Carstensen's Baltic work).

### Goals For Next Week:
