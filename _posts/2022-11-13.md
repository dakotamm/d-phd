# Toward Volume-Based Estimates

### Goals From Last Week:
1. Reach out to Susan Allen regarding DFO data.
2. Review bathymetry datasets for volume-based estimates.
3. Reach out to Kate Hewitt/Greg Johnson for estimation schemes.
4. Pull in updated DFO dataset (from UBC group, now publically available).
5. General lit. review.

### Completed Goals:
1. Reached out to Susan Allen regarding DFO data.
2. Reviewed bathymetry datasets for volume-based estimates.
3. Reached out to Kate regarding estimation schemes.
4. General lit. review.
5. Began pulling in DFO dataset - not complete.

## LO Bathymetries

In reviewing bathymeteries and topographies used for LiveOcean, I found the following two bathymetries for the northern Salish Sea/Strait of Georgia. There are higher resolution bathymetries for Puget Sound, but these are the two I found applicable to the DFO study region. I'd like to select one of these bathymeteries for beginning to estimate state variables using DFO data.

The first appears to be from Salish Seacast's ERDDAP server, collected from: https://salishsea.eos.ubc.ca/erddap/griddap/ubcSSnBathymetryV17-02.html (in 2019, according to the README). Max resoluton???

The second is the "Cascadia_Gridded" dataset with most recent README in 2010. It's a combination of PSDEM, Cascadia USGS, and Smith-Sandwell Cascadia bathymetry. The finest resolution in the Strait of Georgia region is approximately 250m.

### Issues/Questions:
1. I missed the KC meeting on Friday, 11/4/2022 due to the YCSECA. Can we debrief?
2. Takeaways from Stillaguamish/KC meeting.

### Looking Ahead:
1. Reach out to Susan Allen regarding access to DFO data and use requirements.
2. Dig deep into building volume-based state variable estimates (noting Kate Hewitt & Sam Fung as potential resources + Carstensen's Baltic work).

### Goals For This Week:
