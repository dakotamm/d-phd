# LO Casts

### Goals From Last Week:
1. Familiarize with working with segments.
2. Working with extract/casts tools, create sample CTD casts in Strait of Geogia.
3. Starting with DO, get volume-based average DO + hypoxic volume measurements + compare to LO grid "source-of-truth" (with error estimation).
4. Continue organizing DFO data (including unit conversions, compiling CTD + bottle if necessary).
5. Tracking - NANOOS data from source (download and organize).

### Completed Goals:
1. Holidays!
2. Familiarized with working with LO segments - specifically, Strait of Georgia
3. Working with extract/casts tools, create sample CTD casts in Strait of Geogia.

## Creating Sample LO Casts in Strait of Georgia

Back at it after the holidays, I was able to use extract/cast functions and create a sample of LO casts in the Strait of Georgia. To reiterate: the intent with this process is to solidify a method in which I can estimate hypoxic volume (as well as other state variables, hypsographically) using LO output data. Then I can compare to "source-of-truth" LO volumetric grid data.

This step was a challenge in learning how to do casts and also bound the working region to the Strait of Georgia. To create an array of semo-realistic casts, I used DFO lat/lon, but took casts from only (1) LO history file (for ease of local use). Indeed, when I compare to actual DFO data and/or use DFO data, the real dates and times will be utilized. Below is a plot showing (20) sample casts I conducted in the sample region.

Cast locations, surface temperature and salinity vs. bottom temperature and salinity (blue and orange, respectively, subplot 2), and dissolved O2 with depth are shown. </p><br>

Next steps are to create estimation schemes. I suspect parsing the area attributed to each cast will be a learning curve, but I am reviewing literature for a baseline and talking to Kate.

## Miscellaneous/Bookkeeping 
* EFM Talk scheduled for Thursday, March 2, 2023 (20 minute presentation).
* Classes have started!
* Quarter Planning...(in progress)
  * Remaining from last quarter:
    * Come up with estimation scheme using LO data.
  * Dig into obs data management.
  * Prepare for KC meetings.

### Issues/Questions:
1. It looks like there has been significant action in the obs data on LO. I should plug in here.
2. NANOOS data organization - Parker mentioned this during the most recent 1/4/2023 LO group meeting.

### Looking Ahead:
1. Starting with DO, get volume-based average DO + hypoxic volume measurements + compare to LO grid "source-of-truth" (with error estimation).
2. Continue organizing DFO data (including unit conversions, compiling CTD + bottle if necessary).
3. Tracking - NANOOS data from source (download and organize).
