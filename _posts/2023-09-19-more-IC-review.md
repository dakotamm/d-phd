## Continued Review of Initial Conditions

Since returning this weekend, I took a brief exploration of property-property plots for the new initial conditions from observations that we discussed last week, versus the original initial conditions. Reading Aurora's blogpost, this may or may not be immediately relevant to group direction, but I'll include some broad plots for discussion. The following plots show all data for the Salish Sea (the portion I modified with new ICs).

**Note:** I have not changed the parameters of the initial condition calculations given the time off during the last few weeks. I recognize that expanding the window for observations (using a longer period of time) would allow better data coverage. This is just analyzing the initial conditions discussed last meeting.

I also have broken out these property-property plots per region, similar to the below. I have not included all of them for purposes of not overwhelming the blogpost but can happily show them during the meeting. This will allow a more in-depth analysis of regional changes to initial conditions. **EDIT: My segmentation didn't actually work correctly, so disregard this plot. I'll fix this.**

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/dakotamm/dakotamm.github.io/assets/55995675/562e8a43-2bf7-4f6e-a1b1-212ccd5e04a7" width="800"/><br>Fig 9. Strait of Georgia original vs. new initial conditions for 2017 - salt. </p><br>

Overall, there is not excellent agreement between the two initial conditions. My method seems to make broad strokes and significantly modify the existing extrapolations. In general, the new salt is lower than original, new temperature is higher (but with more variation), new NO3 is 0 (analysis needed if this is data or method error), new NH4 is non-zero, new TIC is lower, and new alkalinity is lower. Additionally, oxygen is showing a strange pattern of constancy in various regions that is likely due to undersampling bias, especially in the Strait of Georgia. This is something we identified two weeks ago as a potential issue due to Strait of Georgia long residence times.

Overall, this is a challenging problem that certainly warrants more analysis and refinement. However, I think that should be weighed against the necessity of the exercise. Perhaps only certain regions should be modified? Use a whole years' worth of data? More granular approaches may require a lot more time and effort.

## Questions Toward Paper 1

Leaving this on here for posterity:

1. Is there an observable multi-decadal trend in DO throughout the whole Salish Sea?
   * So far, we've seen that there is really sparse data (in current datasets) before the 2000s. With this data, we can't really make out an upward or downward trend in the Salish Sea as whole, or in the Strait of Georgia, Strait of Juan de Fuca, and Puget Sound as a whole.
2. Are there observable multi-decadal trends in DO throughout different regions? How do regions compare and contrast in DO trends?
   * We DO see some variation since 2000; however, the trend is increasing DO peaking at 2012 and then a decrease. Some regions seem to show a slight decline since 1999 (like South Sound) and some regions show a "mountain" pattern (like Hood Canal).
3. Does DO co-vary with temperature, salinity, NO3, etc.? What are the most significant predictors of DO, if there are any?
4. What's the correlation between environmental indicators and events (i.e., the Blob, PDO, ENSO) that correlate with these trends?
5. Are there significant events that warrant further study, like the Blob?
   * 2015 seems less spicy than anticipated so maybe!

## Bookkeeping 
* Taking classes this fall: Mike's limnology class and data analysis in water sciences.
* Meeting with Susan and Tall 9/20 (obs data sync) - anyone want to join?
* Taylor participating in group meeting on Wednesday 10/18.

### Issues/Questions:
1. Common error estimation methods + statistical bias/error - need lit. review.
2. Organize literature - Endnote or Bibtex.
3. CTD/bottle duplicate DO in ecology set - clean this in VFC (output not affected, only number of casts included).
4. Weird "1-cast = np.nan hyp_vol" issue comes up on 4/2017, 5/2019, and 6/2019. May be an averaging problem.
5. Data cleaning (1950 DO concentrations).
6. Averaging casts in same location.
7. Write VFC-specific command-line tags.
8. Weighted averages are not doing a linear interpolation between gridcell depths yet.
9. Averages below threshold depth are only written for obs data so far.
10. Write plotting functions.

### Looking Ahead:
1. ORCA buoys - incorporate this into trend analysis ASAP.
2. KC data cleaning - ascertain the relative impact to the trends found; complete data incorporation into LO ecosystem.
3. VFC for Aurora's LO output.
4. Getting back into observations analysis.
