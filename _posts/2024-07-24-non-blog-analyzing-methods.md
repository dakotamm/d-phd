# Off-Piste Data Update - Varying Analysis Methods for Long Time History Sites

From our meeting earlier today, we wanted a better way to look at the effects of varying summer definition, analysis type, and averaging schemes on slopes of discussed variables. Here are these plots! (In each, gray markers indicates no statistical signficance with 95% confidence levels.)

*Updated to fix some plot issues from yesterday, 7/23/2024 and add an additional plot for high slopes for surface DO in Saratoga Passage.*

To demonstrate some of the results for increasing DO at Saratoga Passage site, here's a data view for all variables at that site, with summer defined as August-November and no time averaging.
