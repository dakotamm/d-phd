# Off-Piste Data Update - Varying Analysis Methods for Long Time History Sites

From our meeting earlier today, we wanted a better way to look at the effects of varying summer definition, analysis type, and averaging schemes on slopes of discussed variables. Here are these plots! (In each, gray markers indicates no statistical signficance with 95% confidence levels.)

*Updated to fix some plot issues from yesterday, 7/23/2024 and add an additional plot for high slopes for surface DO in Saratoga Passage.*

To demonstrate some of the results for high DO surface trend slope at Saratoga Passage and Lynch Cove, here's a data view for all variables at those sites, with summer defined as August-November and no time averaging.
