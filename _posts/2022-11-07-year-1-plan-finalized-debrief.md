# Year 1 Plan Finalized + Debrief

### Goals for Last Week:
1. Finalize Year 1 schedule + 1-pager for KC by Friday, 11/4.
2. Meeting regarding Port Susan Stillaguamish mooring on Wednesday, 11/2.
3. Start building strategy for volume-based state variable estimates.

### Completed Goals:
1. Finalized Year 1 schedule + 1-pager for KC by Friday, 11/4.
2. Meeting regarding Port Susan Stillaguamish mooring on Wednesday, 11/2.
3. Start building strategy for volume-based state variable estimates - I began to look at methods but did not create any new code due to conference.

### Year 1 Plan - Final

(Here's what I delivered to King County Friday, 11/4, 2022 - mainly for record.

Guiding Science Question: What are the long- (several decade) and short-term (within the last decade) trends in dissolved oxygen and affecting factors in Puget Sound and the Salish Sea?

#### Autumn 2022
*Question/Objective:* Using data from a single source, how has hypoxic volume changed over time in the Salish Sea?
  - Selected data source: Canadian Department of Fisheries & Oceans (DFO) CTD & bottle casts due to temporal range (since 1930s), spatial coverage of the Strait of Georgia, relative completeness within these ranges, and existing data framework.

1. Within existing framework, create method to understand volume-based (hypsographic) estimates for state variables (e.g., temperature, dissolved oxygen).
2. Understand long term trends in hypoxic volume within DFO dataset.

#### Winter 2023
*Question/Objective:* How do trends in hypoxic volume correlate and vary working with more datasets?
  - Additional data sources:
    - King County Marine Water Quality Monitoring
    - WA Dept. of Ecology
    - Collias
    - USGS (rivers)
    - NCDC (climatology)
    - WOAC cruises
    - NANOOS (ORCA buoys)
    - Port Susan Stillaguamish mooring/casts

1. Pull existing datasets into framework.
2. Apply method derived during Autumn quarter for volume-based estimates of state variables to additional datasets.
3. As part of this process, begin to build validation routines for LO.

#### Spring 2023
*Question/Objective:* Synthesize and analyze long-term trends in hypoxic volume and related metrcs for the Salish Sea and Puget Sound.
1. Compare findings in datasets for region-specific information and cross-validation between sources.
2. Begin draft of journal paper: methods, literature review (ongoing).
3. Continue work on LO validation.
4. Compile intermodel comparison benchmark datasets.
5. Potential WOAC cruise (April).
6. Qualifying exams.

#### Summer 2023
*Question/Objective:* Continue to synthesize and analyze long-term trends in hypoxic volume and related metrcs for the Salish Sea and Puget Sound.
1. Target journal paper draft completion by end of summer.
2. Consider conference preparation.

### Debrief from Meeting with King County + Franchesca Perez (marine biologist with the Stillaguamish Tribe)

This meeting assembled Franchesca Perez (Stillaguamish Marine Science), Taylor Martin (KC), Julia Boss (KC), Greg Ikeda (KC), Curtis DeGasperi (KC), Gordon Holtgrieve (UW), Alex Horner-Devine (UW), and me. Lots of new information for me, but exciting to be in converstation with such a knowledgeable group.

A few items:
1. Obviously Franchesca's data seems important - should I reach out to her for access? Or go through KC? (This isn't an immediate need but will definitely be important.)
2. Note Orca College Boeing Pier data.
3. Franchesca mentioned that "seasonal hypoxia isn't what's killing fish" - what is Franchesca's primary concern?
4. Noting strategy to compare subsampled high frequency data in Penn Cove (i.e., mooring) with low frequency data (i.e., casts) and compare findings - how does temporal resolution compare to observed quantities?
5. Julia mentioned LO effort to understand residence times in Port Susan...is this on our task list?

These are not comprehensive notes, but things to discuss during a debrief.

### YCSECA

As a quick note, I had a good time in Pensacola for the YCSECA conference presenting for the Coastal Fronts project I was involved in during the Spring and Summer of this year with Alex Fisher and Jim Thomson. My poster presentation went well, and I got lots of interest in using drone imagery for surface currents. (I'll mention I got many compliments on design - so feeling proud of that!)

### Issues/Questions:
1. I missed the KC meeting on Friday, 11/4/2022 due to the YCSECA. Can we debrief?
2. Takeaways from Stillaguamish/KC meeting.

### Looking Ahead:
1. Reach out to Susan Allen regarding access to DFO data and use requirements.
2. Dig deep into building volume-based state variable estimates (noting Kate Hewitt & Sam Fung as potential resources + Carstensen's Baltic work).

### Goals For Next Week:
