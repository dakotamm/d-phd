## Investigating Trends at Point Jefferson In Slightly Different Ways


From last week, I got feedback to investigate the trends I've been showing in different ways to make the analysis more robust. First, I was asked to include 95% confidence intervals on the slopes of the trend lines that I calculate and use an average value when holding salinity or temperature constant to investigate the effects on stratification and solubility. Here's the annual average "summer" trends at Point Jefferson for all trends that I discussed last week.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/dakotamm/dakotamm.github.io/assets/55995675/6896d9d1-5682-4e9f-9466-153247ab8bd6" width="400"/><br>Fig 1. Point Jefferson DO, temperature, and salinity annual summer averages; light color is surface and dark color is bottom.</p><br>

We draw the same conclusions as last week from these plots and are able to better understand the slope uncertainty.

Next, I was asked to investigate the trends considering ALL casts averaged within depth bins (instead of annual averages), which we thought may have the effect of disproportionately weighting the trend lines toward later years with higher cast density. In this case, I took just a cast average (without then annually averaging) and plotted the values for "summer" trends at Point Jefferson.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/dakotamm/dakotamm.github.io/assets/55995675/71117384-92d3-46a1-9d17-70032a372c75" width="400"/><br>Fig 3. Point Jefferson DO, temperature, and salinity summer casts (depth-binned); light color is surface and dark color is bottom.</p><br>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/dakotamm/dakotamm.github.io/assets/55995675/b26632cd-6abf-462f-b1a0-7e3f9ffc911a" width="800"/><br>Fig 4. Point Jefferson stratification and solubility annual summer casts (depth-binned), observed and holding salinity or temperature constant.</p><br>

We see similar trends, but stronger statistical significance of some trends (like surface DO). However, the slope of surface salinity is lessened in this view, though it is still increasing.

Next I investigated changing the definition of "summer". Previously, I defined it using yeardays 125-325 corresponding to about 85% of hypoxic days throughout the observational data. Now, I'll use August and September as summer months, then take an annual average.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/dakotamm/dakotamm.github.io/assets/55995675/ebc6a84b-dda1-4bde-b554-9c7e046ebaf3" width="400"/><br>Fig 5. Point Jefferson DO, temperature, and salinity annual August-September averages; light color is surface and dark color is bottom.</p><br>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/dakotamm/dakotamm.github.io/assets/55995675/1f965c59-fade-48ed-80f2-9626ecdd52d4" width="800"/><br>Fig 6. Point Jefferson stratification and solubility annual August-September averages, observed and holding salinity or temperature constant.</p><br>

Here's using all casts (depth-binned) instead of annual averages, but considering just August and September.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/dakotamm/dakotamm.github.io/assets/55995675/6bb46454-5533-4e83-afe7-ad8a447c28fe" width="400"/><br>Fig 7. Point Jefferson DO, temperature, and salinity August-September casts (depth-binned); light color is surface and dark color is bottom.</p><br>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/dakotamm/dakotamm.github.io/assets/55995675/bf23c73a-dce6-4941-ba05-3e00b72c5ee6" width="800"/><br>Fig 8. Point Jefferson stratification and solubility August-September casts (depth-binned), observed and holding salinity or temperature constant.</p><br>

Very importantly, we do not see a statistically significant decreasing DO trends as in our previous definition of summer (yeardays 125-325) in either set of averaging methods. Using annual averages only, we also do not see a statistically signficant surface salinity increase overtime. This is a bit troubling given that these are different than our earlier definition of summer!

I investigated some further potential changes that may be happening overtime including change of timing of the DO minima. I also investigated the depth of these observed minima. Here's these figures at Point Jefferson, considering the annual DO minimum (depth-binned per cast) and it's timing and depth.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/dakotamm/dakotamm.github.io/assets/55995675/c7c89317-10b2-4f28-9ecb-b34a587d9394" width="800"/><br>Fig 9. Point Jefferson minimum annual DO (depth-binned per cast), timing of minimum annual DO, and depth of minimum annual DO overtime.</p><br>

This plot does not show any clear trends over time, but does yield some interesting observations. First, the "minimum" depth-binned cast value may be at the surface. This seems to indicate years when casts were not taken at full-depth and corresponds to "high" minimum DO values and earlier yeardays during which the minima occur. Now, we only focus on our the bottom 20% of the water column to capture only deep casts and water column minima.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/dakotamm/dakotamm.github.io/assets/55995675/04f24439-42c4-41b7-9105-588f6041be4c" width="800"/><br>Fig 9. Point Jefferson minimum annual DO in bottom 20% depth-bin, timing of minimum annual DO, and depth of minimum annual DO overtime.</p><br>

Here we see that there is significant range in annual DO minima at depth. DO minima that occur earlier in the year tend to by higher DO overall. There is some minor variation in the average depth of the depth-binned cast value.

Ultimately, I think I've given myself too much to chew on and am not entirely sure how this could help explain the effect of differing summer seasons. Certainly more work is required to understand further.

## General Exam Notes

Leaving my General Exam notes here for future reference...

Some good notes from the discussions:
1. Lots of great audience comments - Melissa Moulton mentioned using idealized terminal inlets for hypothesis testing using LO.
2. Mike notes that using "sensitivity" or lack thereof when it comes to Puget Sound nitrogen is sticky, given that the balance of nutrients in the system is equally importance (ref. Mackas & Harrison 1997 figure).
3. Mike recommends using quantitative model assessment, like "model skill score" or RMSE.
4. Mike indicated interest in decadal analysis of river nutrient variability with CT/SA/DO - sent me a nice spreadsheet that he and Ben have workedo on with USGS data from 1948.
5. Mike also indicated interest in other long-term correlations with largescale climate like PDO - e.g., using Race Rocks to correlate both with interdecadal variability in Puget Sound obs + climate oscillation.
7. Comments on "avoiding inadvertant p-hacking" - basically, layout all my data analysis steps.
   * Taylor recommended bootstrapping techniques, using Mann-Kendall trends with Thiel-Sen slope (and checking residuals when using linear-regressions...)
   * Taylor/Alex recommended instead of "no slope detected" - explain the minimum detectable slope given data, say that slope does not exceed that.
   * Group discussed propagating errors through to final results - e.g. what is the uncertainty on my solubility calculations given CT/SA etc. - 7/1/2024: just doing calculations with measured values then assigning 95% confidence intervals for now
   * Also - listing out all the slopes and uncertainties, comparing slopes across sites, keeping 95% confidence interval on slopes... - 7/7/2024: doing this last point now
   * Investigate "step trends" as well as full time series
   * Consider % change vs. absolute changes, like with stratification!
8. Mike pointed out the importance of winter properties on DO minima...consider this in more expanded analyses.
9. Penn Cove - pull in Ecology data as well + Coupeville wharf
10. Emily Herrington - reach out to for Penn Cove data, especially on mussel growing stuff? - Michelle to connect us

Homework
1. ~~Check into stratification plot labelling issue - confirmed that I just mislabeled. The stratification is DEEP density less SURFACE density in sigma [kg/m^3]. All indicated trends and interpretations are accurate with regards to my calculations, and that was just a typo. Oops, but at least I didn't totally mess up some simple math!~~ - ylabel typo fixed
2. ~~Better solubility calcs using CT/SA - ref. [Garcia and Gordon (1992)](https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.4319/lo.1992.37.6.1307) per Mike.~~
   * ~~Parker recommended calculating relative contributions of both overtime.~~ - see 7/1/2024 blogpost
4. ~~Make sure I know equation of state specifics better - unit change in temperature vs. salinity impact on density.~~ - same as above
5. Parker HW question - can we do a box model to estimate a respiration rate from observations, say in Penn Cove? Basically, what can change our simple DO decay that I scraped together on the board (~ DO(t) = DO_i*e^(t/T)) where T is the time after which DO(T) = DO_i/e (or the e-folding timescale)?
6. Mike HW question - using LO & SSM rates for settling and POC degradation and mean PS depth/Penn Cove depth/etc., how much organic matter reaches the sediment intact? Does water column or sediment respiration seem to dominate?
7. Taylor HW question - compare linear regression trends to Mann-Kendall (broken out by seasons) and bootstrapping/subsampling vs. simple time-averaging, plot residuals for linear regressions!
8. ~~Taylor fieldwork question - looks like some ADCPs in Penn Cove are possible! Where and how long? What other field data would be helpful in Penn Cove?~~ - meeting with Taylor 7/3/2024
