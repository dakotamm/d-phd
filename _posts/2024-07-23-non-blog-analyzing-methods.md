# Off-Piste Data Update - Varying Analysis Methods for Long Time History Sites

From our meeting earlier today, we wanted a better way to look at the effects of varying summer definition, analysis type, and averaging schemes on slopes of discussed variables. Here are these plots! (In each, gray markers indicates no statistical signficance with 95% confidence levels.)
