# Reviewing Year 1 Plan

### Goals for Last Week:
1. Continue to familiarize myself with pandas/general python/LO.
2. Work on 1-pager for KC review meeting (likely a statement of intent; incorporate Baltic Sea examples of direction from Science of Salish Sea workshop, data source availability in relation to Baltic and existing, etc.).
3. Work on specifics of Year 1 plan (consider main focus: e.g. trends in DO over many decades, temporal and spatial variation in modern times, etc.).

### Completed Goals:
1. Continue to familiarize myself with pandas/general python/LO.
2. Work on 1-pager for KC review meeting.
3. Work on specifics of Year 1 plan.

This week, I've created a rough draft Year 1 plan, for both our use and for King County (upon refinement).

### Year 1 Plan

#### Autumn 2022
1. Build confidence with Python data analysis. This includes continued course-style learning (i.e., Python for DS, Parker's computing class) and also using available data sets and processing scripts to come up to speed (e.g., DFO ctd/bottle samples).
2. Gain understanding and wrangle data sets from all applicable sources. Sources (to my knowledge and from Parker's website) are:
    - BC DFO
    - WA Dept. of Ecology
    - King County
    - Collias (for longer term trends)
    - USGS (rivers), NCDC (climatology)
    - WOAC cruises
    - NANOOS (ORCA buoys)
    - Port Susan Stillaguamish mooring
    - more...?
4. Solidify data focus topic. Current ideas:
    - *Long-term trends in Puget Sound and the Salish Sea.* This has been somewhat addressed by Mike & Parker, so understanding where I need to start and extend from will be necessary. From Baltic precedent, understand potential perennial, seasonal, and episodic trends in hypoxia and relate to climate trends.
    - *Temporal/seasonal trends in the Salish Sea over the last decade(-ish).* This would include more in-depth understanding of perennial/seasonal/episodic trends. Given higher fidelity data of recent times, this would look towards calculating hypoxic volume/area and spatial/temporal variation.
    - (Realistically - a combination would be important...?)

#### Winter 2023
1. Work on data focus topic. Identify gaps in data.
2. Begin building validation routines for LO. Work with LO team + Aurora for where I can be the most useful.
3. Conference applications?

#### Spring 2023
1. Begin draft of journal paper on data focus topic...?
2. Work with Aurora/LO team to test and implement validations. Track completion by end of spring quarter.
4. Potential WOAC cruise (April).
5. Qualifying exam...?

#### Summer 2023
1. Work on journal paper draft...?
2. Conference preparation...?
3. Zoom in on Penn Cove data (data gap) - toward potential data collection proposal...?

### Issues/Questions:
1. Where does WWTP effluent data come from? WWTP plants themselves? KC?
2. Is my data source list complete?

### Looking Ahead:
1. YCSECA - poster preparation happening this week (I'll need some focus time for that).
2. Finalize Year 1 schedule + 1-pager for KC.
3. Continue work on coming up to Python/LO speed.

### Goals For Next Week:
