# Working with LO DO Outputs

### Goals From Last Week:
1. Create time series of total hypoxic volume/average DO concentration.
2. Start working with segments - get with Parker.
3. Figute out LO "casts" to start depth-based estimation scheme.
4. Concatenate/organize DFO data (nco tools).

### Completed Goals:
1. Create time series of total hypoxic volume/average DO concentration.
2. Start working with segments - get with Parker.
3. Working with DFO data on perigee (it's big).

## Finding LO Hypoxic Gridcells

Over the last week, I cleaned up the process of working with LO DO outputs. I was able to get bottom DO volume as it evolves over a test time period, get hypoxic volume as it evolves over time, and also work with simple calculations like weighted average DO. The following GIF shos

### Issues/Questions:
1. The fatal for-loop: how to avoid? - Line comprehensions, broadcasting, fancy indexing, masking, etc.
2. How does sample only portions of the domain? Smart ways to restrict just to Strait of Georgia, say? - Parker has segments built.

### Looking Ahead:
1. Create time series of total hypoxic volume.
2. Figure out LO "casts" - start depth-based estimation scheme.
3. Concatenate/organize DFO data (nco tools).
4. Get Endnote up and running - lit. review + notetaking - on backburner***.

### Goals For This Week:
1. Create time series of total hypoxic volume/average DO concentration.
2. Start working with segments - get with Parker.
3. Figute out LO "casts" to start depth-based estimation scheme.
4. Concatenate/organize DFO data (nco tools).
