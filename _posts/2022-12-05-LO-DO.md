# Working with LO DO Outputs

### Goals From Last Week:
1. Find hypoxic cells in LO - be able to plot/calculate total volume.
2. Figure out LO "casts" - start depth-based estimation scheme.
3. Concatenate/organize DFO data (nco tools).
4. Get Endnote up and running - lit. review + notetaking.

### Completed Goals:
1. Find hypoxic cells in LO - be able to plot/calculate total volume.

## Finding LO Hypoxic Gridcells

Some success! After lots of learning, I feel more confident in how to use LO .nc outputs and plot them. I was able to visualize the dissolved oxygen on 11/30/2022 for a single hour (01:00 UTC), but I'm excited to build up from here.

Next, I was able to start finding gridcells that could be considered "hypoxic" (defined as < 2.0 mg/L O2). Here again I am able to plot only grid cells falling below that threshold at the surface and bottom.

In both of these plots, we see the clear trend of bottom oxygen lower than at the surface. At this point, there appear to be no gridcells indicating hypoxic conditions in LO at the modeled time; however, bottom hypoxia is evident within the Strait of Georgia.

As of 2:20pm PST on 12/5/2022, I was trying to produced a time series of hypoxic volume from LO 11/15/2022 through 11/30/2022...and it's not working yet. But I am able to calculate total hypoxic volume for a single output file. Largely a work in progress but I'm learning may way through.

### Issues/Questions:
1. The fatal for-loop: how to avoid?
2. How does sample only portions of the domain? Smart ways to restrict just to Strait of Georgia, say?

### Looking Ahead:
1. Create time series of total hypoxic volume.
2. Figure out LO "casts" - start depth-based estimation scheme.
3. Concatenate/organize DFO data (nco tools).
4. Get Endnote up and running - lit. review + notetaking.
