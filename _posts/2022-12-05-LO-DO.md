# Working with LO DO Outputs

### Goals From Last Week:
1. Find hypoxic cells in LO - be able to plot/calculate total volume.
2. Figure out LO "casts" - start depth-based estimation scheme.
3. Concatenate/organize DFO data (nco tools).
4. Get Endnote up and running - lit. review + notetaking.

### Completed Goals:
1. Find hypoxic cells in LO - be able to plot/calculate total volume.

## Finding LO Hypoxic Gridcells

Some success! After lots of learning, I feel more confident in how to use LO .nc outputs and plot them. I was able to visualize the dissolved oxygen on 11/30/2022 for a single hour (01:00 UTC), but I'm excited to build up from here.

Next, I was able to start finding gridcells that could be considered "hypoxic" (defined as < 2.0 mg/L O2). Here again I am able to plot only grid cells falling below that threshold at the surface and bottom.

### Issues/Questions:
1. See above discussion.

### Looking Ahead:
1. Find hypoxic gridcells - get "source of truth" hypoxic volume from LO output.
2. Figure out LO "casts" - start depth-based estimation scheme.
3. Concatenate/organize DFO data using nco tools.
4. Get Endnote up and running - lit. review + notetaking.

### Goals For This Week:
1. Find hypoxic cells - be able to plot/calculate total volume.
2. Figure out LO "casts" - start depth-based estimation scheme.
3. Concatenate/organize DFO data (nco tools).
4. Get Endnote up and running - lit. review + notetaking.
